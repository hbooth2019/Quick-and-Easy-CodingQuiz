Welcome to my coding quiz, i've put together this small HTML/CSS/JAVA inspired webpage to test your knowledge on coding with 8 questions on a timer.


i have listed 8 questions with 4 multiple choice answers.
ive included 3 files such as 

1.index.html (the base webpage)
2.logic.js (the javascript logics)
3.styles.css (small styling sheet)

i was not able to get much onto the styling sheet, need to review basic concepts to be able to fluently put out better content, was stressed about getting the javascript and html to align that i did not spend too much time on the CSS.

the game is mostly functional with an issue of storing the highscores ( i ran out of time and could not figure it out on this one).

lots of error,and felt no confidence in writing a README due to not being satisfied myself with the content i have pushed, hoping this will become easier to understand in the coming weeks.
